      <div class="accordion-body">Foaming Cleansers: These are ideal for removing excess oil and dirt from the skin's surface. CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser is a recommended option, containing niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and ceramides to cleanse without stripping the skin's natural moisture.
Toners: Alcohol-free toners like Murad Clarifying Toner can help balance oily complexions by reducing sebum production and tightening pores. It contains witch hazel and algae extract to effectively reduce shine.
Serums: Serums such as The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% Oil Control Serum are beneficial for oily skin due to their ability to control oil production and reduce the appearance of enlarged pores. Niacinamide is a key ingredient that helps in brightening the skin and reducing inflammation.
Moisturizers: Oil-free moisturizers like Tatcha The Water Cream provide lightweight hydration without adding to the skin's oiliness. They help maintain the skin's moisture balance and minimize the appearance of pores.
Sunscreens: Sunscreens like EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 are suitable for oily skin as they offer protection without clogging pores. They are oil-free and help in maintaining a matte finish.
Exfoliants: Products containing salicylic acid, such as Paula’s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant, are effective in unclogging pores and reducing inflammation. Salicylic acid is a beta-hydroxy acid (BHA) that is oil-soluble and can penetrate into the pores to remove dirt and dead skin cells.
Clay Masks: Clay masks, such as La Roche-Posay Effaclar Shine Control Face Mask, are beneficial for oily skin as they help absorb excess oil and impurities from the pores. Different types of clay, such as bentonite, are effective in removing impurities and detoxifying the complexion. <code>.accordion-flush</code> class. This is the first item's accordion body.</div>

      <div class="accordion-body">Gentle Cleansers: Use non-irritating cleansers that remove impurities without over-drying. Options include foaming, gel-based, or creamy formulas. Recommended products include CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser, Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser, and Clarins Purifying Gentle Foaming Face Cleanser.
Toners: Alcohol-free toners help restore the skin’s pH balance, remove residual oil, and hydrate dry areas. Look for toners with ingredients like niacinamide, glycolic acid, or rose extracts. Examples include Fenty Skin Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum and L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Derm Intensives 5% Glycolic Acid Peeling Toner.
Serums: Multi-purpose serums can address various concerns. Hyaluronic acid hydrates dry patches without greasiness, while niacinamide regulates sebum production and strengthens the skin barrier.
 Azelaic acid helps refine pores and calm redness, and exfoliating serums with AHAs or BHAs (like glycolic or salicylic acid) can improve texture and unclog pores.
Moisturizers: Use lightweight, oil-free, or gel-based moisturizers to avoid adding shine to oily areas while still hydrating dry zones. Products like Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel-Cream, La Roche-Posay Effaclar Mat, and Biossance Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer are suitable.
Sunscreen: A daily, lightweight, non-greasy broad-spectrum SPF of at least 30 is essential. Options include SkinCeuticals Daily Brightening UV Defense Sunscreen SPF 30 and Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun Rice + Probiotics (SPF50+).
Exfoliants: Chemical exfoliants like AHAs (glycolic, lactic acid) and PHAs are preferred over physical scrubs for their gentleness. Use once or twice weekly to remove dead skin cells and prevent clogged pores.
Masks: Multi-masking—using different masks on different areas—can target specific concerns. Clay masks help absorb oil in the T-zone, while hydrating sheet masks benefit dry cheeks.
Key Ingredients: Niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, ceramides, and salicylic acid are particularly beneficial for balancing and protecting combination skin.
Avoid harsh, comedogenic, or fragranced products that can irritate or clog pores, and tailor your routine to seasonal or hormonal changes <code>.accordion-flush</code> class. This is the second item's accordion body. Let's imagine this being filled with some actual content.</div>

    <div id="flush-collapseThree" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="flush-headingThree" data-bs-parent="#accordionFlushExample">
      <div class="accordion-body">Gentle Cleansers: Use fragrance-free, non-comedogenic cleansers, such as oil-based or milky cleansers, which remove impurities without stripping natural oils.
 Examples include oil cleansers paired with a damp microfiber cloth 
 or milky oil cleansers.
Humectants: Look for ingredients like hyaluronic acid, glycerin, panthenol (vitamin B5), and lactic acid, which attract water to the skin from the environment or deeper layers, helping to hydrate dry skin.
Emollients: These ingredients soften and moisturize the skin by replenishing lipids. Common emollients include ceramides, shea butter, cocoa butter, jojoba oil, sunflower seed oil, rosehip oil, and squalane.
Occlusives: These create a physical barrier on the skin to prevent moisture loss. Effective occlusives include petrolatum, mineral oil, beeswax, argan oil, and dimethicone.
Moisturizers: Use a rich moisturizer twice daily. Day creams should ideally include broad-spectrum SPF 30 or higher to protect against sun damage, which can worsen dryness.
 Night creams can be heavier and contain ingredients like niacinamide to support barrier repair and hydration.
Face Oils: For very dry skin, applying a face oil as the final step in your nighttime routine can help lock in moisture.
Serums and Treatments: Hydrating serums containing hyaluronic acid and ceramides are beneficial.
 Alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) like lactic acid can gently exfoliate dead skin cells, improving texture and allowing better absorption of moisturizers, but should be used cautiously.
Body Care: Use body creams or soufflés with plant butters, oils, and ceramides to hydrate skin from the neck down.
 Products with shea butter and glycerin are particularly effective.
Lifestyle Practices: Limit showers to 5–10 minutes with lukewarm water, avoid harsh soaps, and apply moisturizer to damp skin to seal in hydration.
 Staying hydrated by drinking adequate water also supports skin health <code>.accordion-flush</code> class. This is the third item's accordion body.
